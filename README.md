# Support-system-for-deaf-dumb

Communication is the key of exchanging ideas and information but the problem arises when normal people want to convey a message to a deaf/dumb person because the language used by the deaf/dumb people is Sign Langauge.

This project helps a normal person to convey a message to a deaf/dumb person. The input can be given in text or speech format in around 100 languages which is converted to sign characters or a small video is shown which conveys the information.
